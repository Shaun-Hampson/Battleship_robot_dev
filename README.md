## Project Description

Project to design a small scale battleship using [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) to drive all functions on board. Project is intended to be used as a tool for developing and learning features such as Locomotion, Navigation, Perception, ect.

The user will have primary control, however, the battleship systems will aid with obstacle avoidance and relay visual data from guns to the user.

### Water Simulation
From [Gazebo/Tutorials - Hydrodynamics](https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=hydrodynamics&cat=physics):
buoyancy force on object = volume of object * density of fluid * gravity\\
***BuoyancyPlugin***
A Gazebo Plugin that calculates the buoyancy force on the each link of a model and applies the force to the center of the link.
